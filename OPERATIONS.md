# Operations runbook

This runbook covers deployment, a one-run production pilot, restart, transfer,
cleanup, and final completeness verification. Nothing in the preparation or
benchmark performed on 2026-08-28 submitted a HepJob task or deleted cluster
data.

## Safety gates

Production requires all of the following:

- an explicit user order to start;
- the destination disk mounted at the path passed as `--mount-root`;
- every one of the fixed catalog files readable;
- `--execute --confirm-start START-DYB-PRESERVATION`;
- for automatic cluster cleanup,
  `--delete-remote-after-sync --confirm-remote-delete DELETE-VERIFIED-RUN`.

The program rechecks the mount immediately before and after each transfer.
Remote cleanup is impossible until local SHA-256 verification succeeds and the
local catalog/schema match the remote finalized run.

## Preflight

From this repository on the local machine:

```bash
make test
python3 preserve.py deploy
```

The second command is a dry run. After the explicit start order, deploy and
compile under the pinned IHEP LCG 110 environment:

```bash
python3 preserve.py deploy \
  --alias dayabay1 \
  --remote-code-root /dybfs2/users/lijj16/DYB_DATA_PRESERVATION/code \
  --execute
```

Then require a clean fixed-catalog inventory:

```bash
python3 preserve.py inventory --alias dayabay1
```

The command exits nonzero if any catalog is unreadable. Do not bypass this
gate; retry after the filesystem issue is resolved.

## Dry run and first one-run pilot

Replace both `/Volumes/DYB_DISK` examples with the real mounted disk paths.
This selection command only reports the planned work:

```bash
python3 preserve.py run \
  --local-root /Volumes/DYB_DISK/data \
  --mount-root /Volumes/DYB_DISK \
  --period P17B --hall EH1 --limit-runs 1
```

After reviewing the selection and receiving the start order, the same one-run
pilot becomes executable only with both confirmation phrases:

```bash
python3 preserve.py run \
  --local-root /Volumes/DYB_DISK/data \
  --mount-root /Volumes/DYB_DISK \
  --period P17B --hall EH1 --limit-runs 1 \
  --execute --confirm-start START-DYB-PRESERVATION \
  --delete-remote-after-sync \
  --confirm-remote-delete DELETE-VERIFIED-RUN
```

Inspect that local run with `verify-local` before expanding the selection.

## Full run

Omitting period, hall, pattern, and limit selects all fixed catalogs. This is
the command to use only after the one-run pilot is accepted:

```bash
python3 preserve.py run \
  --local-root /Volumes/DYB_DISK/data \
  --mount-root /Volumes/DYB_DISK \
  --execute --confirm-start START-DYB-PRESERVATION \
  --delete-remote-after-sync \
  --confirm-remote-delete DELETE-VERIFIED-RUN
```

Defaults are 16 source files per task, HepJob group `dyw`, `short` walltime,
1,024 MB memory, two submission attempts, and a two-hour per-run wait. Override
only after measured evidence from the production pilot.

## Restart and recovery

- Re-run the same command after an SSH interruption or failed task. The run
  marker fixes the catalog and chunking; valid outputs and timing reports are
  reopened, verified, and skipped.
- A catalog checksum, period, hall, or `--files-per-job` mismatch is refused.
- A failed transfer remains under `.RUN_STEM.incoming` and never authorizes
  remote deletion. Re-running resumes `rsync` and rechecks all hashes.
- If the external disk disappears, remount it at the same `--mount-root` and
  rerun. Do not manually move `.incoming` into its final name.
- If a run exhausts both attempts, inspect its remote `logs/*.err` and
  `status/*.fail`; no cleanup occurs.
- Never manually remove a remote run until the corresponding local
  `verify-local` command succeeds.

## Per-run timing file

`durations.tsv` is tab-separated and follows the fixed source catalog order:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `fileIndex` | zero-based index in the run catalog |
| `chunkIndex`, `sourceIndex` | output chunk and index within that chunk |
| `path` | original absolute ROOT path |
| `entries`, `inputBytes` | source event count and original byte count |
| `firstTriggerTimeSec/NanoSec` | earliest trigger timestamp in the source |
| `lastTriggerTimeSec/NanoSec` | latest trigger timestamp in the source |
| `dataDurationSeconds` | `(latest_ns - earliest_ns) / 1e9` as a double |
| `processingWallSeconds` | source read plus compression-flush wall time |
| `processingCpuSeconds` | source read plus compression-flush CPU time |

The seconds/nanoseconds columns make the acquisition duration independently
recomputable without subtracting large floating-point epoch values.

## Completeness verification

Per run:

```bash
python3 preserve.py verify-local /Volumes/DYB_DISK/data/P17B/EH1/RUN_STEM
```

After the full campaign:

```bash
python3 preserve.py verify-all /Volumes/DYB_DISK/data
```

`verify-all` requires exactly every run in `catalog-inventory.json`, rejects
unexpected run directories, matches catalog hashes and source counts, checks
one duration row per catalog source in exact order, checks the exact ROOT chunk
set, and recomputes every artifact SHA-256 and byte total.

Where a compatible ROOT installation is available, add structural reopening:

```bash
make converter
python3 preserve.py verify-all /Volumes/DYB_DISK/data \
  --root-verifier ./bin/slim-root
```

The converter then checks required trees and branches, equal event-tree entry
counts, source-entry totals, finite nonnegative timing values, and exact
agreement between each double data duration and its integer timestamps.
